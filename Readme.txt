# AI Fusion Hackathon – Project Nexus (Victory Sniffer)

## 🧠 Overview
**Project Nexus** is an AI-powered campus super-app prototype built for the **AI Fusion Hackathon**.  
It integrates multiple intelligent modules to simplify daily campus life, student collaboration, local exploration, and academic planning.

This repository contains the **backend logic and AI-powered prototypes** implemented using **Python and Streamlit**, with a focus on explainable and hackathon-safe AI workflows.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Modern campus life is fragmented across emails, notice boards, messaging apps, and disconnected platforms.  
Students miss deadlines, struggle to coordinate, and lack intelligent tools tailored to campus needs.

**Project Nexus** addresses this by providing a unified, AI-assisted system across four core pillars:
- Daily Pulse
- Student Exchange
- Explorer’s Guide
- Academic Cockpit
